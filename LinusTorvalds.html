    <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
    <p>Linus torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creater
       and principle developer of the Linux Kernal,which is the kernal for a number 
       of operating systems. He also created the version control sysytem Git. Torvalds 
       was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki,Finland. He studied computer science at 
       the University of Helsinki. and he developed the Linux kernal as a student project in 
       1991. Since then , Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernals in 
       the world,powering everything form smartphones to supercomputers.

    <h2 id="early life">Early Life</h2>
    <p>
        Linus Torvalds was born to Finnish journalists and 1960s radicals Anna and Nils Torvalds in Helsinki, Finland, in 1969.
        His mother translated for Finnish newspapers and produced graphics, while his father, a Communist, was a radio journalist.
        His father, Nils is the grandson of Leo Törnqvistand, a Finnish statistician, and the poet Ole Torvalds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many people think that Linus Torvalds’ parents named him after the Peanuts cartoon character Linus Van Peltz.
        Linus himself agrees, but he’s actually named after the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist Linus Pauling.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Linus’ parents divorced when he was young, and his mother and grandparents brought him up.
        His childhood was otherwise unremarkable. His family ensured that he was literate and read widely from an early age.
        Linus’ wider family came from a Swedish-speaking minority in Finland, numbering 300,000 people.

    <h2 id="career">Career</h2>

    <h3>University of Helsinki</h3>
    <p>
        Linus Torvalds developed his interest in computing by studying Computer Science at the University of Helsinki,
        the alma mater of his parents. His studies commenced in 1988, and he graduated with a Master’s in Computer Science in 1996.
        He worked as part of the Computer Science department’s NODES research group that continues to undertake research on distributed and networked systems and applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of his studies, Torvalds learned about and worked with the Unix OS, whose multi-user,
        multitasking attributes influenced his development of Linux. His Master’s thesis was titled “Linux: A Portable Operating System.”
    </p>

    <h3>Finnish military service</h3>
    <p>
        The completion of mandatory military service interrupted Torvald’s studies.
        In 1989 Torvalds joined the Finnish Navy Nyland Brigade and completed an 11-month officer training program serving as an artillery observer.
        He achieved the rank of second lieutenant. He went back to university in 1990. 
    </p>

    <h3>The development of Linux</h3>
    <p>
        Exposure to the powerful processors and stable <a href="https://history-computer.com/unix-operating-system-guide/">Unix operating system</a> of Helsinki University computers inspired Linus Torvalds to take the leap of developing his own operating system.
        During the later part of his studies, he got a PC with a 33MHz <a href="https://history-computer.com/intel-history/">Intel</a> 386 processor and 4MB of memory, a huge amount at the time. Though the capabilities of the computer impressed him,
        he found the MS-DOS operating system disappointing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        He started developing the operating system that became Linux because he could not get a copy of the Unix OS for his computer to replace MS-DOS. Torvalds wanted an OS that could take full advantage of the 386 processor.
        He tried to use a copy of Minix he procured through academic contacts. This also did not meet his needs as it was not fully open-source. 
    </p>

    <h2 id="inventions">What Did Linus Torvalds Invent?</h2>
    <p>
        Linus Torvalds developed several pieces of software, but none have eclipsed the success of Linux.
    </p>

    <h3>The Linux kernel</h3>
    <p>
        Linus Torvalds is the creator of the Linux kernel, the core of the Linux operating system. It is named after the center of a seed. 
        The kernel is an essential interface between the hardware of a computer and the software programs that run on it. 
        Applications interact with the kernel via a system call interface (SCI). The kernel controls both layers and efficiently manages the computing resources. 
        When operating normally, it should be imperceptible to the user, occupying its own space in the system known as “kernel space,” while areas the user accesses are part of the “user space.”
    </p>

    <p>On a computer, the Linux kernel performs four functions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The kernel manages the system memory, keeping track of available memory and storage locations.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Linux kernel manages the use of the central processing unit (CPU). It controls which processes use the CPU and for how long.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Linux kernel also operates as a device driver for key hardware processes.
        </li>
        <li>
            The kernel also manages service requests from various processes.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Git</h3>
    <p>Linus Torvalds is also the original author of Git, another open-source software, this time for distributed version control. It was released in 2005. </p>
    <p>Torvalds originally developed git to track changes to the Linux kernel, but it is now widely adopted by software developers and engineers who work collaboratively. </p>
    <p>Developers use Git for developing authoritative source code with contributions from multiple authors. It can support numerous workflows across distributed systems and platforms. </p>
    
    <h3>Subsurface</h3>
    <p>
        In 2011, Linus Torvalds developed a multi-platform open-source software for diving called Subsurface. Divers use Subsurface for recreational, professional, and free-diving. 
        Divers can run Subsurface on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and it is compatible with commercial dive log software that includes MacDive, Suunto DM4, and JDiveLog.
    </p>
    <p>Subsurface can plan and track dives with data feeds that include GPS coordinates, equipment logs, and diver characteristics.</p>

    <h2 id="Books">Linus Torvalds: Published Works and Books </h2>
    <p>Linus Torvalds has been a co-author of two books:</p>

    <h3>The Hacker Ethic</h3>
    <p>Linus Torvalds co-authored The Hacker Ethic with Pekka Himanen and Manuel Castells in 2001. 
       This treatise compares the ethics and values of Western capitalism with the moral code of hackers to challenge readers on the direction of the Information Age. 
       Linus Torvalds contributed to the introduction. 
    </p>

    <h3>Just For Fun – The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary </h3>
    <p>Linus Torvalds is the co-author of Just For Fun – The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary with David Diamond. The book was published in 2002. 
       This lighthearted autobiography charts Torvalds’ rise from a nerdy Helsinki techie to the creator of a groundbreaking operating system. 
       The book offers fans an opportunity to gain insight into Linus’ “quirky mind” and his revolutionary perspective and values.
